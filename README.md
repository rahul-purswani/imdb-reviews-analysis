## Overview
This project aims to reveal patterns and trends in movie reviews, providing insights into how sentiments and ratings change over time. By performing Sentiment Analysis, Temporal Analysis, and Correlational Analysis, this study seeks to understand the dynamics of audience opinions and their evolution, ultimately offering a comprehensive view of movie review sentiments. Additionally we also built a sentiment prediction model that predicts the sentiment of a review.<br></br>

<b>Key Components:</b>
1. Data Extraction â€“ Web Scraping:
   - Utilized Selenium and Chromium WebDriver to scrape data from IMDb pages.
   - Collected data from the top 100 highest-rated and lowest-rated movies on IMDb, resulting in 200 movies for analysis.

   - Generated a sentiment column based on review ratings, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral.

3. Sentiment Analysis:
   - Created word clouds to visualize common words in positive, negative, and neutral reviews.
   - Developed a sentiment prediction model using TF-IDF vectors and logistic regression, achieving an overall accuracy of 84%.

4. Temporal Analysis:
   - Analyzed how review ratings and sentiments changed over time.
